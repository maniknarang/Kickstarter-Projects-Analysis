# Kickstarter Data Analysis and Visualization
Cleaned, visualized, analysed and built a classifier using publicly available
data on different kinds of projects from https://kickstarter.com, to determine
which categories of projects become successful in achieving their pledged amounts,
and which categories of projects fail within a particular timeframe.

More details/work in the Jupyter Notebook named "<b>Kickstarter - Jupyter Notebook</b>".
